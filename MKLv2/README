I. Experiement Design

    Experiment 1: 1-feature-vector
        features = {'TFIDF', 'keyword', 'image_rgba_gist', 'image_rgba_phog'}
        Gamma = [0.1 1 10 15 20]

    Experiment 2: 2-feature-vector
        features = {'TFIDF+keyword', 'image_rgba_gist+image_rgba_phog'}
        Gamma = [0.1 1 10 15 20]

    Experiment 3: 4-feature-vector (50 kernels)
        features = {'TFIDF+keyword+image_rgba_gist+image_rgba_phog'}
        Gamma = [0.1 1 10 15 20]


II. Run Experiments
    
    1. go to experiment folder, e.g. exp_1
    2. edit batch file, e.g. single_exe.m or parallel_exe.py
    3. execute the batch file


III. Run Experiment with same Seed (Only for single execution)
    
    This seed is designed to let the experiment can be reproduced so that
    we can easily debug or re-run our experiment based on the same datasets.

    Steps of generating seed: 
        1. matlab -r common/batchGenSeed.m:
        2. copy the fixed_exp_seed.mat to the destinated experiment folder, 
           like 'exp_1' (don't change the file name, the experiment only recognize this file name)
        3. execute the experiment

IV. Ploting

    (1) Bar Chart
    
    1. Use common/mklv2_test_result_to_csv.m to transfer .mat output to .   csv. You can refer drawing/batchExp1EvalToCsv.m for example.

        Note 2: 
            You could modify the input file name in the drawing/batchExp1EvalToCsv.m to do what you want.

    2. Use drawing/batchPlotExp1FromCsv.py to plot bar chart.
        
        Note 1: 
            I use matplotlib in Enthought Canopy python package on Win7 to plot the chart.
        Note 2: 
            You should modify the input csv file name in the drawing/batchPlotExp1FromCsv.py to do what you want.

    3. Exp2, Exp3, Exp4 use the similar philosophy.
