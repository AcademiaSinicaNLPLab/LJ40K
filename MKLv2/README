I. Experiement Design

    Experiment 1: 1-feature-vector
        features = {'TFIDF', 'keyword', 'image_rgba_gist', 'image_rgba_phog'}
        Gamma = [0.1 1 10 15 20]

    Experiment 2: 2-feature-vector
        features = {'TFIDF+keyword', 'image_rgba_gist+image_rgba_phog'}
        Gamma = [0.1 1 10 15 20]

    Experiment 3: 4-feature-vector (50 kernels)
        features = {'TFIDF+keyword+image_rgba_gist+image_rgba_phog'}
        Gamma = [0.1 1 10 15 20]


II. Run Experiments
    
    1. go to experiment folder, e.g. exp_1
    2. edit batch file, e.g. single_exe.m or parallel_exe.py
    3. execute the batch file


III. Run Experiment with same Seed (Only for single execution)
    
    This seed is designed to let the experiment can be reproduced so that
    we can easily debug or re-run our experiment based on the same datasets.

    Steps of generating seed: 
        1. matlab -r common/batchGenSeed.m:
        2. copy the fixed_exp_seed.mat to the destinated experiment folder, 
           like 'exp_1' (don't change the file name, the experiment only recognize this file name)
        3. execute the experiment
